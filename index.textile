h2. Welcome to the Trekking for Cancer Website

In May of 2011, Louis Jacques contracted with the Himalayan Glacier Trekking LLC to be part of an Expedition that begins in Kathmandu, Nepal on April 3, 2012.  The expedition is to be a 19-day trek, through the Mount Everest Base Camp at 17,462 feet, climaxing at Kala Patthar at 18,192 feet, and returning to Kathmandu, Nepal.

h2. American Cancer Society

The American Cancer Society is the motive and purpose behind this trek.  The organization provides support to individuals with cancer, their loved ones, and the research and education that helps prevent and cure the disease.  With your help, the fight against cancer is not a hopeless battle.  You make a difference.  The first step is an easy one: if you are interested, you can read more about the American Cancer Society's connection to this adventure on "the ACS page":/acs, or you can "donate directly to ACS":/donate.

In Kathmandu now waiting for my flight home tomorrow.

Here are the following updates;

h3. Trekking day 11 April 15th:

Exhausted from yesterday's long trek to Base Camp but we did it.
This morning up at 4:30 am to begin another long exhausting. First we left at 5am to
climb Kala Patthar, elev 18,209ft. Climbing with head lamps on to get up there for the
sunrise.  It was too early for the kitchen to be open so I just
took my water bottle that was at room temperature (not sure how cold it was last night
in my but I slept in my bag with clothes on, gloves, and a hat) instead of having the kitchen
staff put how water in the bottle per usual. Anyway half way my water is frozen, not solid
yet but still can't get water out of it. Climb was really steep and very difficult. Was a little
disappointed in the fact that Everest is still off in the distance and you can only see the top
part. Anyway got the pictures and we came back down to Gorak Shep to have breakfast and
to Periche as we begin the return trek to LUKLA. We get to Periche at 5pm so it's been a long
hard day, also we trekked the last two hours in a driving snow storm. Had dinner at 6:30pm
then off to bed to rest for tomorrow.
 
h3. Trekking day 12 April 16th

Today we trek to Tengboche. Up at 6am, usual time, and begin our trek at
at 8am. The trek today is very difficult. Even though we are on our way back the last 2 hours
to Tengboche are steep and difficult. We arrive at 3:30pm. Get settled into our rooms and then
go to visit the monastery here. Very popular place that actually has 14 monks living there. We
take pictures and go back to our rooms to rest. Have dinner at 6:30pm in bed by 8pm to ready
for tomorrow. Today was a clear day so I took many pictures. The scenery is so spectacular you
could be taking pictures every 10 minutes. A scarry thing happened to me about 2 hours out from
Periche. Lucky I'm alive to talk about it. My guide is walking in front of me as usual and he points
out to me about 6 grazing Yaks heading down the side of the mountain towards our trail. He was
calling out to me because the lead Yak had two small calfs following her. As I continued it became
apparent that we were about to reach the narrow trail at the same time. I paused, the Yak paused,
I'm thinking there's not enough room on this trail for the two of us so I decide to cut in front of her as
quickly as I could. My guide watches in horror as the Yak takes one step towards me and swings her
head at me. Her right horn hits me in the thigh(still have the bruise) but fortunately it was a glazing
blow as I was trying to scurry by her. My guide thought the Yak had either gored my hip or buttocks.
Thank God the curved part of that horn hit me and not the tip. Also the glancing blow kind of help
propel me forward rather than sideways which would have been certain death as I would have been
knocked of the trail and down the steep side of the mountain. Wow, can't believe how close that came.
We talked about the incident the rest of way on to Tengboche.
 
h3. Trekking day 13 April 17th:

This morning we leave Tengboche for Namche Bazaar. Another fairly long trek
as I'm walking slower now. Just physically tired of the day after day exhausting up and down trekking.
We walk down as we leave Tengboche but as the trail winds around the mountain side we find ourselves
trekking upwards again even though Namche is at a lower altitude. Again the day is clear so many Photo
opportunities. I will have to sort through them all when I get back because I think many pictures are simply
more of the same. Spectacular scenery but similar as well. We reach Namche at 4pm. We stayed at the same
lodge as we did on the way up. Had the opportunity to go to an internet cafe there and use SKYPE to talk to
Joyce. It was good talking to her. Having no phone has left me feeling so Isolated. People who have working
phones are talking all the time. My wonderful Verizon Global Phone hasn't worked since I got here. After the
Internet cafe visit and went to my room. Took a HOT shower. It's an enclosed outdoor shower but it's been awhile
(since we were here on trekking day 2) so it felt so good. Had dinner then off to bed to rest for tomorrow.
 
Love and Peace to all;
Louis
