h2. Welcome to the Trekking for Cancer Website

In May of 2011, Louis Jacques contracted with the Himalayan Glacier Trekking LLC to be part of an Expedition that begins in Kathmandu, Nepal on April 3, 2012.  The expedition is to be a 19-day trek, through the Mount Everest Base Camp at 17,462 feet, climaxing at Kala Patthar at 18,192 feet, and returning to Kathmandu, Nepal.

h2. American Cancer Society

The American Cancer Society is the motive and purpose behind this trek.  The organization provides support to individuals with cancer, their loved ones, and the research and education that helps prevent and cure the disease.  With your help, the fight against cancer is not a hopeless battle.  You make a difference.  The first step is an easy one: if you are interested, you can read more about the American Cancer Society's connection to this adventure on "the ACS page":/acs, or you can "donate directly to ACS":/donate.

h3. Day 3

Rest and acclamatization day. Short trek today to an observation area. This allows us to climb up several hundred feet more and go back down to sleep in Namche and continue to trek upward. Climb high sleep low to help acclimate. At the observation point we got our first view of Everest along with the other peaks on each side of her. Because of the high winds at the summit, blowing snow was creating clouds of snow coming of the peak. Everest is still a long way off but getting the first look was awesome.

Hopefully I will have some internet access at the next stop. I'm doing fine even though each day pushes you to the limit and then get up the next day and start over again.

Love and peace to all  
Lou
