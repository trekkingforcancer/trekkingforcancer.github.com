I'm at the hotel in Kathmandu and they have a business center so I'm using their computer. Everything works fine. When I try to use my verizon droid with WIFI I can't get to the web site. I puts me in to Zenexter shows your name and GITHUB etc.   Weird I'm also having trouble getting to my email with the droid but not the computer. right now I'm not very happy with verizon and the way they set me up with this global phone. It sucks!! Unless things change it looks like I will have to call you everyday for my updates and the pictures will have to come off this piece of crap phone they sent me.

I'm in Kathmandu. Arrived yesterday at 2:30pm. All went well with the flights. The people for Himalayan Glacier picked me up at the airport and took me to my hotel. Today was a day of sightseeing and preparation. I leave thurs morning at 5am for my flight to Lukla and begin the trek. On little tid bit of info. The other people I was going with backed out over the last couple weeks so I"m going it alone. They have given me a guide and sherpa as my porter and all set to leave in the morning. Not as excited about doing it alone as opposed to walking with a group. They me the option to leave on Friday with another group but they were taking a faster and tougher route then what I signed up for so decided to go it alone.  Nor sure what updates I will be able to provide as the trek moves along. My droid is no help at all so it looks like phone calls at $2.89/minute. Txt are only .50 to send and .05 for me to receive, but hard to txt with the old fashion flip phone with the numbers like on the old fashion phones, so you have to have to hit the same key three times to get to the last letter ie. the number 2 for abc etc......

Sorry  there has been no postings yet but my global phone stopped working. Just died and can't revive it not even doing cpr on it. So no communication capabilities until today. This is day 3 of the trek. I'm in Namche Bazaar. Rest and acclamitazation day after the grueling 8 hour trek for Pakding. Itinerary and brochure says 6 hours, wishfull thinking. Maybe they don't want to scare people away. I'm at an internet cafe in Namche you I have access to a computer.

h3. Day 1

the flight into LUKLA was awesome and landing on that 1600ft remote air strip in the mountains was really cool. I was sitting in row 1 right behind the pilot & co-pilot, no door on these planes. The pilot climbs into his seat through a side window. I was able to hold my camera about their heads and record the landing. pretty cool. Once we landed it was get the gear and start treking to Pakding. Took 4 hours of some pretty tough uphill and downhill trekking. Rested in the afternoon and got to bed early for the long day tomorrow. Food by the way is really good. Rice, vegetables, and great soups.

h3. Day 2

Start the trek at 8am for what turned out to be an hour trek to Namche Bazaar. This was the most grueling thing I have ever done. Other than a 1 hour stop for lunch at a tea house it was 7 hours of constant uphill rather steep climbing  on trails that were mostly stone steps. I have probably lost 5 lbs in the last 2 days. I'm at 11,280ft. Pretty cold. Glad to have a good warm sleeping bag because no heat in the sleeping areas.

h3. Day 3

Rest and acclamatization day. Short trek today to an observation area. This allows us to climb up several hundred feet more and go back down to sleep in Namche and continue to trek upward. Climb high sleep low to help acclimate. At the observation point we got our first view of Everest along with the other peaks on each side of her. Because of the high winds at the summit, blowing snow was creating clouds of snow coming of the peak. Everest is still a long way off but getting the first look was awesome.

Hopefully I will have some internet access at the next stop. I'm doing fine even though each day pushes you to the limit and then get up the next day and start over again.

Love and peace to all  
Lou
