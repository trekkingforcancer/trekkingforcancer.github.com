h1. Getting the Source Code

"GitHub Project Page":https://github.com/Zenexer/E2M

If you do not know what to do from there, you probably should not be messing with the source code.

h1. Contributing Your Changes

We use the typical GitHub methodology.  Fork the master branch, push your commits to your own repository, then make a pull request to merge your fork back into the master branch.

You will need to be using Git and GitHub to contribute changes.  I will not accept changes/patches in any other form.  Fork, modify, and make a pull request.  Do not send me a patch.  It promptly be fed to my rabbit.

h2. Coding Style

Tabs, not spaces.  No exceptions.

Other style preferences should be self-evident.  Follow them or have your pull request denied.  Proper styling is not optional.

h2. Sounds like too much work.  Never mind.

Then at least file a bug report (doubles as means for feature requests) so someone else can consider contributing the changes.

Besides, if that sounds hard, you probably would not have done a very good job of programming your changes anyway, and I would have denied the pull request as a result.
